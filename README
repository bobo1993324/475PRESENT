How to use PRESENT:

Setup: 
	Key size: 80 bits or 128 bits
	Key requirements: No. Any 80 bits or 128 bits can be the key.
	
	Initialize key as a string, 10 or 16 in length. Pass to the initializer of Present class.
	
	For example.	

	include <present.h>
	...
	string key = "1234567890"; //length must be either 10 or 16
	Present p(key);

Encryption:
	Input Block size: 64 bits
	Output Block size: 64 bits

	Initialize message as a string, 8 in length. Pass to the encryption of Present instance. The output is the corresponding cypher, a string of length 8.

	For example.
	
	string message = "12345678";
	string c = p.encrypt(message);

Decryption:
	Input Block size: 64 bits
        Output Block size: 64 bits

	Pass a cipher as a string of length 8 to the decryption of Present instance. The output is the original message, a string of length 8.

        For example. (Assume c is the cipher we get from encryption)

        string m = p.encrypt(c);

SEE main.cpp for the whole example.
SEE Makefile for how to build.
